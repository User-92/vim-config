# vim-config
My .vimrc file I use for programming in vim

## How to use:
* Copy the config settings from the `vimrc.txt` file
* Paste the config settings into your own vimrc file
* Write the changes
* Run `:source &`
* Finally, run `:PlugInstall` to install all of the plugins

To see the changes, you have to quit out of vim and open it again.
