# vim-config
My .vimrc file I use for programming in vim

## How to use:
* Copy the config settings from the `vimrc.txt` file
* Paste the config settings into your own vimrc file
* Write the changes
* Install vim-plug (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
* Run `:source &`
* Finally, Run `:PlugInstall` to install all of the plugins


* To setup YouCompleteMe, change directory to `~/.vimrc/plugged/YouCompleteMe` and run `python3 install.py`

To see the changes, you have to quit out of vim and open it again.
